Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Titanic Dataset

Project Overview
This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
The goal is to explore, visualize, and extract meaningful insights about passenger demographics and survival patterns.

Objective

Explore and understand the dataset.

Identify relationships between passenger features (age, class, sex, etc.) and survival.

Detect patterns, anomalies, and trends.

Gain hands-on experience with EDA tools in Python.

Tools & Libraries

Python 3.x

Pandas – for data cleaning and manipulation

NumPy – for numerical computations

Matplotlib – for basic plotting

Seaborn – for advanced statistical visualizations

Jupyter Notebook – for interactive analysis and reporting

Open the Jupyter Notebook

Run All Cells
Run the notebook cells sequentially to view visualizations and insights.

Key Analysis Steps

Data Loading and Inspection

Using .info(), .describe(), .head() to understand structure and data types.

Missing Value Analysis

Visualized using sns.heatmap() to detect null values.

Univariate Analysis

Histograms, boxplots, and countplots to study individual features.

Bivariate Analysis

Comparing survival rate across class, sex, age, and fare.

Correlation Analysis

Correlation heatmap to show relationships between numeric variables.

Pair Plots

Using sns.pairplot() for multivariate relationships.

Observations & Insights

Written interpretations for each plot and pattern found.

Key Insights

Females and upper-class passengers had significantly higher survival rates.

Most passengers were between 20–40 years old.

Third-class passengers made up the majority but had the lowest survival rate.

Fare and passenger class showed a strong inverse correlation.

Deliverables

Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) – includes code, visuals, and inline observations.

PDF Report (.pdf) – summary of findings and visuals.

Learning Outcomes
By completing this project, you will:

Gain confidence in EDA using Python libraries.

Learn to visualize data effectively to uncover insights.

Develop a systematic approach to understanding datasets.

Future Enhancements

Apply machine learning models for survival prediction.

Add feature engineering and data preprocessing steps.

Compare results using other datasets (e.g., Iris, Tips).
